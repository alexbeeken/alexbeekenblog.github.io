-Hello visitors to my website and blog!
-
-I'm Alex Beeken, aspiring junior web developer and student at Epicodus in Portland, OR. I've been learning to code for almost two years. Along the way I've worked on projects involving C, Objective C, PHP, SQL, Ruby, and Javascript.
-
-Before I decided to become a programmer I was a part time Choir Teacher in Flagstaff, AZ at Coconino High School and a part time Library Assistant at Flagstaff High School. Although I loved working in education, I've found my real passion in working with technology.
-Whether professional or personal, I hope to create some exciting things with the new skills and experience I'm gaining at Epicodus.
